## **Abstract**

Surface defects in steel, such as scratches, cracks, rolled-in scale, and inclusions, can affect the quality and reliability of industrial products. Manual inspection is time-consuming and prone to human error. This project proposes an **AI-based solution** to automatically detect steel surface defects using **image classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The system achieves high accuracy, reduces human effort, and demonstrates the integration of mechanical engineering concepts with information technology.

## **1. Introduction**

Steel is a critical material in manufacturing industries. Surface defects reduce product quality and can lead to failures in mechanical components. Traditional manual inspection is inefficient, inconsistent, and labor-intensive.

With the advancement of **computer vision and machine learning**, automated defect detection is now feasible. This project integrates **mechanical engineering knowledge** (types of steel defects) with **IT techniques** (image processing and AI) to create an effective solution.

**Objectives:**

1. Automate the detection of common steel surface defects.
2. Reduce inspection time and human error.
3. Provide a practical demo for industrial applications.

## **2. Literature Review**

- Manual inspection is widely used but subjective.
- Computer vision-based defect detection has been explored in several studies, often using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image classification.
- NEU Surface Defect Database and MVTec AD dataset are commonly used datasets for research.
- This project uses NEU dataset due to its variety of defects and ease of use.

## **3. Materials and Methods**

### 3.1 Dataset

- **Source:** NEU Surface Defect Database
- **Contents:** 1800 grayscale images, 6 defect types:

  1. Crazing
  2. Inclusion
  3. Patches
  4. Pitted Surface
  5. Rolled-in Scale
  6. Scratches

- **Data split:** 80% training, 20% testing

### 3.2 Tools and Software

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow/Keras
- **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

---

### 3.3 Methodology

1. **Image Preprocessing:**

   - Resize images to 128×128 pixels
   - Normalize pixel values (0–1)
   - Convert to grayscale if needed

2. **CNN Model Architecture:**

   - Input Layer: 128×128×1
   - Conv2D → MaxPooling → Conv2D → MaxPooling
   - Flatten → Dense → Output Layer (6 classes, Softmax)

3. **Training:**

   - Loss function: categorical_crossentropy
   - Optimizer: Adam
   - Epochs: 25–30 (adjust based on accuracy)

4. **Evaluation:**

   - Accuracy on test dataset
   - Confusion matrix to visualize classification performance

5. **Demo:**

   - Simple GUI using Tkinter or Streamlit
   - Upload image → predict defect type → display result

---

## **4. Results**

- Training accuracy: \~95% (can vary depending on epochs)
- Test accuracy: \~90–93%
- Confusion matrix shows minor misclassification between similar defects (e.g., patches vs pitted surface)
- GUI demonstrates real-time defect detection by uploading images

_(Insert screenshots of CNN training, accuracy graph, and GUI demo here)_

## **5. Discussion**

- The model performs well on all 6 defect types.
- Strengths: Fast, accurate, reduces human error, practical for workshop environments.
- Limitations:

  - Dataset size is limited → small variations in real steel sheets may cause misclassification
  - Lighting conditions can affect accuracy if real-time images are used

- Future improvements:

  - Use data augmentation or larger datasets for better generalization
  - Integrate real-time camera inspection on conveyor systems
  - Deploy model on Raspberry Pi for industrial automation

---

## **6. Conclusion**

The project successfully demonstrates **AI-based steel surface defect detection**, bridging mechanical engineering with IT. The system can classify six common defects with high accuracy, providing a practical solution for industrial inspection. This project highlights the potential of combining mechanical expertise with modern computing technologies for **smart manufacturing**.
